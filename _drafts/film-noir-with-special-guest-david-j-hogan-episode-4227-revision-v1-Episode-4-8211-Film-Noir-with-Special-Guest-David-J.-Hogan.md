In this episode we talk about film noir as a genre, as well as our favorite film and femmes fatales.

EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE: We had a small recording problem that will become evident towards the end of the episode. It sounds like Nick and Erik are talking over David, but this is an error in the recording software. Most of it is fixed, and it is still easily listenable; it simply sounds like we are being rude at times, when we are not.

From the Film Noir FAQ description:

> Film Noir FAQ celebrates and reappraises some 200 noir thrillers representing 20 years of Hollywoods Golden Age. Noir pulls us close to brutal cops and scheming dames, desperate heist men and hardboiled private eyes, and the unlucky innocent citizens that get in their way. These are exciting movies with tough guys in trench coats and hot tomatoes in form-fitting gowns. The moon is a streetlamp and the narrow streets are prowled by squad cars and long black limousines. Lives are often small but peoples plans are big &#8212; sometimes too big. Robbery, murder, gambling; the gun and the fist; the grift and the con game; the hard kiss and the brutal brush-off. Film Noir FAQ brings lively attention to story, mood, themes, and technical detail, plus behind-the-scenes stories of the production of individual films. Featuring numerous stills and postersmany never before published in book formhighlighting key moments of great noir movies. Film Noir FAQ serves up insights into many of the most popular and revered names in Hollywood history, including noirs greatest stars, supporting players, directors, writers, and cinematographers. Pour a Scotch, light up a smoke, and lean back with your private guide to film noir.
