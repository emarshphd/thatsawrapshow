Join us as we share our thoughts,  
criticisms and general reactions to this  
year&#8217;s Oscar winner for Best Original  
Screenplay _**Her**_.  Very much a topical film  
that addresses many &#8220;here and now&#8221; issues  
and technologies (although it&#8217;s set in a near  
future), Spike Jonez&#8217;s film generates a lot  
of pathos from its main characters and calls  
into question the very nature of relationships.  
How are they defined? Refined? Built?  
Dismantled?  **Her** seems to have impressed the  
_That&#8217;s A Wrap_ guys an awful lot.
