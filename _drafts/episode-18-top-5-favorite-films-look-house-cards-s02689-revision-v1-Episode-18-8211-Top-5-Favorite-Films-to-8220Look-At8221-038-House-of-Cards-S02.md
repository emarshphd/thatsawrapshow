Erik, Nick and Chris discuss their very favorite films to &#8220;look at.&#8221; We each take turns presenting our TOP 5 best-loved films that we admire simply for their visual beauty.   A tough task to be sure, but we did our best and include a brief short-list of honorable mentions at the end.  In segment two, we discuss Season 2 of House of Cards which was Netflix&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day gift to subscribers.  We don&#8217;t exactly agree about everything with this show, but we all admire it a lot.
