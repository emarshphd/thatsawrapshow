In episode #41, your hosts (Erik Marshall, Nick Schlegel and Chris Gullen) discuss Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s eighth feature film _The Hateful Eight _and _Star Wars: The Force Awakens. _We start with a discussion of Tarantino in general before diving into the film. Spoiler: 2/3 of us loved the movie.

In segment 2, we turn into a bunch of salivating fanboys before launching into a _slightly_ more critical stance on the latest in the _Star Wars_ franchise, directed by JJ Abrams.

We also talk about children giving spoilers, people trying to retain ownership of things they&#8217;ve sold (\*cough\* \*cough\* George Lucas),  and our upcoming mini-episodes on all of the Best Picture Academy Awards nominees.
