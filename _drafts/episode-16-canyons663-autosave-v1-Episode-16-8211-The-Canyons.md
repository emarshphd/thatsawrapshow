In their year-ending episode, Erik, Nick and Chris discuss Paul Schrader&#8217;s _The Canyons_ from every possible angle. The film polarized critics yet was appreciated by scholars and cinephiles. In segment 2, the guys discuss their favorite episodes and moments over the maiden year of the podcast.

Finally, Erik Marshall, Nicholas Schlegel and Christopher Gullen would like to thank our loyal listeners for all of the support during this first year and wish you all the warmest of holidays and happiest new year.
