Do you recall the days when spectacle-driven &#8220;event&#8221; cinema was the exception, the anticipated shining star among other more mid and low concept films.  Nowadays, it seems it&#8217;s the other way around.  This is not to say that we don&#8217;t have films to counter this increasingly stupid strategy (Erik and I just went and saw, and podcasted, about Before Midnight), but this approach from studios has prompted very vocal (and negative) responses from George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Steven Soderbergh (among others).  This is the focus of That&#8217;s a Wrap #8: The Current State and Future of Cinema.  It pairs nicely with a robust but elegant little podcast &#8211; Chateau &#8220;That&#8217;s a Wrap #2, vintage 2013&#8221; (On Demand Culture).
