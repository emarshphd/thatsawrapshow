Happy New Year from That&#8217;s a Wrap!  We&#8217;re back for the new year and thrilled to have author and historian <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=ted+okuda" target="_blank">Ted Okuda</a> wrap with us for Episode #31.  We talk about Ted&#8217;s books, the project of film history, the constant politicizing of films and upcoming projects.  It was a blast and we&#8217;re sure you&#8217;ll enjoy the show!

In Pickups, we also discuss documentarian Frederick Wiseman&#8217;s recent visit to Detroit and the Michigan premiere of his latest, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3720794/" target="_blank">The National Gallery.</a> Nick and Erik attended the premiere and stayed for the Q&A afterwards. Nick was fortunate enough to have breakfast with Frederick the next morning where they talked about various subjects.[
