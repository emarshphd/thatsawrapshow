The Hunt tells the tale of Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen), a divorced day-care worker (laid off from his secondary ed position) wrongly accused of sexually inappropriate behavior with his best friend&#8217;s daughter, Klara.  Before long, groupthink hysteria brings the community to brutal acts of cruelty against Lucas and his family.

Our second segment presents some random recommendations from the _That&#8217;s a Wrap!_ staff.  Erik discusses a favorite Youtube Web-series, Nick recommendations a childhood favorite and Chris props up a graphic novel he admires.
