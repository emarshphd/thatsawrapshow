In this special episode, Erik, Nick and Chris have a roundtable with Mike White and Rob St. Mary, hosts of the fantastic _The Projection Booth_ podcast. The guys all discuss the question on whether or not film is still relevant. Over the last decade, technological, social, economic and aesthetic changes have forced filmmakers, studios, audiences, critics and scholars to address not only how cinema as an art form has been altered (especially with regards to its consumption), but how it remains germane in society&#8217;s collective conscious. No other art form has the potential to touch us in the same manner as cinema so the discussion is both timely and engaging.
