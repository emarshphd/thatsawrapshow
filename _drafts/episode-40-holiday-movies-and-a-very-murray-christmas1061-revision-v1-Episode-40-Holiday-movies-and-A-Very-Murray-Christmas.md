This time Nick, Erik and Chris tackle holiday movies, including movies explicitly about Christmas and movies we like to watch during the holiday season. It&#8217;s a fun, loose conversation with some cinematic gems. We then decided to watch the Netflix special _A Very Murray Christmas_, directed by Sofia Coppola and starring Bill Murray and Paul Schaffer, along with Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rashida Jones, George Clooney, Miley Cyrus and a bunch more.

Some movies mentioned:

_White Christmas_, _A Christmas Carol_, _A Christmas Story_, _Odessa File_, _Rudolph the_ Red Nosed _Reindeer_ by Rankin/Bass, _Cash on Demand_, _Christmas Evil_ and more.
