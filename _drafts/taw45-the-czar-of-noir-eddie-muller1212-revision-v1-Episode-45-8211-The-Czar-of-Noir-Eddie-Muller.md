Erik and Nick  had the pleasure of recently talking to Eddie Muller, the _Czar of Noir._ Erik met Eddie at a Noir City event at the Redford Theatre in Metro Detroit. Our discussion touches on film noir as a genre, including the views of Andrew Sarris and Paul Schrader,

Our discussion also covers the following topics:

  * Film noir as a genre
  * Auteur theory and looking at noir from the perspective of the producer
  * The views of Andrew Sarris and Paul Schrader and their influence on how we think about film noir
  * The Production Code
  * Many different films, including _99 River Street_, _The Devil Thumbs a Ride_, _Cry Danger_, _Cry of the City_,  _Woman on the Run_, _Larceny_, _Moonrise_, _Sign of the Ram_
  * Ann Sheridan, Evelyn Keyes, Jean Porter, Norman Foster, Victor Mature, Jane Greer
  * Licensing issues
  * Film restoration
  * Generating interest among younger viewers
  * And lastly, Eddie tells us an interesting story about Rose McGowan

We hope you enjoy!
