  Erik and Nick were impressed by Alfonso Cuaron&#8217;s Gravity.  In fact, they&#8217;ve dedicated a supplemental episode between shows 13 and 14 to this juggernaut.  In many ways, Gravity represents a possible model that Hollywood should seriously take to heart.  The film&#8217;s narrative simplicity, with its focus on character, location and behavior coupled with special effects that serve the story (while enhancing it simultaneously) are the perfect recipe for box-office magic, critical favor and killer word of mouth (particularly when seen in IMAX 3D).  Please join us for this special episode of That&#8217;s a Wrap &#8211; GRAVITY.
