The translation process from page to screen is endemic to the industry and is of _particular importance_ to the public when the source is a beloved and/or bestselling novel, novella or graphic novel. (_Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, Little Women, A Clockwork Orange, The Da Vinci Code, Watchmen, 300, Gone With The Wind, Of Mice and Men, Les Miserables, Lolita_, etc).  This adaptation process incurs tremendous (and often, misguided) debate as to what was ultimately &#8220;better&#8221; &#8212; the film or the novel, when in fact, comparison of these two very different mediums requires proper _contextualization_. Our mission in Episode #5 is to each list our favorite three adaptations from novel to screen and also provide a snapshot of what we think makes for an &#8220;effective&#8221; translation from one medium to another.<figure id="attachment_258" style="width: 269px" class="wp-caption alignright">

We also take some time to acknowledge some titles that we would love to see successfully adapted into motion pictures (or conversely, fear that they will be _un_successfully adapted!).  In the case of Nick and Erik, a prime contender in this category is Theodore Roszak&#8217;s complex, ambitious and classically &#8220;oh-so-hard-to-adapt&#8221; novel about the very nature of cinema, 1991&#8217;s &#8220;Flicker.&#8221;  In the final summary, some things are lost in translation and some things are gained.  These are two very different mediums that are often measured commensurately.  When a literary source is adapted into a film, comparisons are inevitable, but in our estimation, it&#8217;s not which &#8220;version&#8221; is &#8220;better&#8221;, it&#8217;s more about whether the story is well-suited for its new cinematic interpretation and is the essence translated from one medium to another?
