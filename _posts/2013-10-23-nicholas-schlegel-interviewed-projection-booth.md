Nick broadly discusses the Spanish horror boom experienced in Spain from roughly around 1968-77 (the boom years for production).  Later, they discuss the very brilliant Narciso Ibáñez Serrador&#8217;s _¿Quién puede matar a un niño?_ (AKA _Who Can Kill A Child?) _and its 2012 remake _Come Out and Play._

We invite you to listen and subscribe to our good friends at The Projection Booth (clearly one of the greatest cinema-based podcasts on the planet).  In fact, That&#8217;s a Wrap and The Projection Booth are joining forces for an upcoming podcast &#8220;Roundtable&#8221; on the state of cinema and WHY FILM MATTERS.  Coming soon!
