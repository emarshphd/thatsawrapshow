Hello Everyone.

[show_avatar email=3 align=left]Nick Schlegel here with a link to a wonderful interview I participated in while I was recently in Manhattan for theÂ [_Music & The Moving Image Conference_](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/music/scoring/conference)Â Â While there, my friends Eddie Samuelson and Eric Cohen of <a href="http://cinefilestv.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Cinefiles</em></a> and <a href="http://thisisinfamous.com/" target="_blank"><em>This is Infamous</em></a> provided an evening of fine dining and libation&#8211;Brooklyn Roof-Top Style! Â The result is the above interview about Spanish Horror Films and the Spanish film industry in general during the late 1960s and 70s when horror production surged tremendously during Spain&#8217;s new transition from dictatorship to democracy. Â I hope you enjoy it half as much as I had making it. Â My book is currently undergoing revisions and should see publication early next year. Â ðŸ™‚**
